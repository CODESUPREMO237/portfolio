## The Evolution of the Senior Engineer

Early in my career, I assumed principal engineers were just faster coders. That assumption was wrong.

As you move from senior to staff/principal, your output shifts from code volume to risk reduction and leverage creation.

### Dictating Trade-offs

Engineering is choosing the right imperfect system for current business constraints.

- **Do we need Kafka?** Not for tiny workloads. A Postgres queue with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` may be enough.
- **Do we need microservices?** Usually only when team coupling cost exceeds distributed-system operational tax.

Principal-level engineering is often saying no to unnecessary complexity while preserving future options.

### Deleting Code as Leverage

One of my highest-impact PRs was deleting tens of thousands of lines from a legacy billing engine.

Code is liability:

- it must be patched
- it must be monitored
- it must be maintained through platform changes

Sometimes the highest leverage move is changing product requirements so software does not need to exist.

### Mentorship Through Architecture

If operating your system requires every engineer to be exceptional, the system design is weak.

Good architecture creates pits of success:

- safe defaults in CI/CD
- typed contracts and boundaries
- observability that makes failure obvious
- guardrails that make the right path the easiest path

Leadership at this level is building systems and processes that let the whole org move faster with lower risk.
